# Cinema Manager
## Inspiration
I found this project on jetbrains java for beginners course. The lessons before each stage implementation were annoying because I knew most of the concepts, but were super useful for familiarizing myself with Java syntax.

## Functionality
- Display the seating arrangement in the hall.
- Buy tickets.
- View stats on how many tickets sold, income, highest possible income with the available seating arrangement.
- Basic exception handling.

## Parting thoughts
I'm looking to implement a game now that involves more OOP style programming (which is what Java is for). This is a great basic project though if you just wanna get familiar with Java. It was especially useful for me since I've been coding in Python for a long time and haven't touched C, C++ since my 2nd year.
